# curlconverter

This extension adds a "Paste cURL as \<language\>" option to the right click menu when you're editing a Python, JavaScript, PHP, R, Go, Java, Rust or JSON file.

The JSON output is not in any standard format, you can think of it as [curlconverter](https://curlconverter.com/)'s parser's internal state.

The version of curlconverter is much older than the one on https://curlconverter.com due to a technical limitation of VS Code.
